Controlling the hovering of a crazyflie drone using PID

I wanted to try control the hover height of a crazyflie drone myself through a PID controller.

I tried it myself firstly, just tuning randomly until I found something that somewhat worked, see figure 1.

Then I followed the Ziegler-Nichols method, wikipedia has a good overview (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziegler%E2%80%93Nichols_method).
